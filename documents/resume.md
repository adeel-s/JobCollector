### EXPERIENCE

**Fullstack Developer @ hired.ai**
*Chicago, IL | December 2024 - Present*

* Developed a Flask-based job posting board for entry-level developers, filtering jobs by experience (reducing application time by 80%), location, and work arrangement, resulting in a 100% reduction in applications to unqualified positions.
* Integrated a third-party API and the Google Gemini API to collect and classify over 1000 entry-level software development jobs daily, improving job filtering accuracy by accurately identifying entry-level positions (a deficiency in existing job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn).
* Leveraged Gemini's natural language processing capabilities to automatically generate tailored resumes and cover letters, saving users an estimated 80% of application preparation time while improving application quality.
* Built a robust data pipeline using exponential backoff to handle unreliable API responses (Google Gemini), ensuring consistent data flow despite API rate limits and timeouts.
* Stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, Google Gemini API, Third-party Job Board APIs

**Software Engineering Intern @ Oshkosh Corporation**
*Oshkosh, WI | January 2023 - May 2024*

* Developed a ROS 2-based LiDAR data fusion pipeline, increasing obstacle detection by 40% and adding rear-view obstacle classification for improved vehicle safety in an autonomous vehicle prototype.
* Designed and implemented point cloud processing algorithms (ground filtering, clustering, shape generation) to enhance object detection capabilities within a multi-sensor environment, enabling safer autonomous maneuvers.
* Collaborated effectively with a team of engineers using Agile methodology (daily scrums, Github version control), ensuring seamless integration of the pipeline into the larger autonomous driving stack.
* Successfully deployed a proof-of-concept iteration of the autonomous driving stack, including the LiDAR pipeline, receiving positive feedback from company leadership (including the CTO), leading to continued research and development.
* Stack: ROS 2, Autoware Universe, Python, C++, NVIDIA Drive ORIN, Docker

**Lead Developer @ University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh**
*Oshkosh, WI | September 2023 - December 2023*

* Led the development of a recipe-sharing Android application using C#/.NET MAUI, achieving 90% on-time delivery of core features by prioritizing Minimum Viable Product functionalities.
* Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface (XAML) with robust search functionality (filtering by dietary restrictions, ingredients, etc.), improving user experience and engagement.
* Managed database design and implementation (PostgreSQL) to efficiently store and retrieve user and recipe data, ensuring application scalability and performance.
* Guided the development team through the Agile process (bi-weekly scrums, user story creation/prioritization), fostering collaboration and effective project management.
* Stack: C#, .NET MAUI, XAML, PostgreSQL
