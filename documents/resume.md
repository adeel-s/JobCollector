### EXPERIENCE

**Fullstack Developer @ hired.ai**
*Chicago, IL | December 2024 - Present*

* Developed a Flask-based job posting board for entry-level developers, filtering jobs by experience (0-3 years), location, and work arrangement, resulting in a 80% reduction in time spent on unqualified applications by users.
* Implemented a robust data pipeline using Python and third-party APIs (Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Gemini) to acquire and process 5,000+ daily job postings, improving data accuracy by 20% compared to general job boards.
* Leveraged Google Gemini's API to classify job descriptions by experience level (reducing mismatches by 75%), remote eligibility, and salary, enabling users to efficiently target appropriate roles.
* Generated customized resumes and cover letters using Gemini, enhancing application quality and increasing user success rate by at least 15% (based on user feedback).
* Stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jinja, Google Gemini API

**Software Engineering Intern @ Oshkosh Corporation**
*Oshkosh, WI | January 2023 - May 2024*

* Developed a ROS 2-based LiDAR data fusion pipeline in Python and C++, increasing obstacle detection by 40% and adding rear-view obstacle classification for an autonomous vehicle prototype.
* Improved vehicle mapping capabilities by concatenating data from two LiDAR sensors, reducing blind spots and improving safety for autonomous pull-up maneuvers.
* Implemented a Docker container for seamless deployment of the pipeline onto the NVIDIA Drive ORIN SOC, accelerating integration into the autonomous stack.
* Collaborated in an Agile environment using Git for version control and daily scrums, successfully deploying a proof-of-concept iteration and receiving leadership approval for further development.
* Stack: Proprietary ROS 2 Autoware Universe Python/C++ build running on NVIDIA Drive ORIN Embedded compute unit
