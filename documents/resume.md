### EXPERIENCE

**Fullstack Developer @ hired.ai**
*Chicago, IL | December 2024 - Present*

* Developed a Flask-based job posting board for entry-level developers, increasing application efficiency by 80% and eliminating applications to unqualified roles entirely.
* Implemented a robust data pipeline using Python and Google Gemini API to process job postings from multiple sources (Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter), accurately filtering for entry-level roles (a feature missing from major job sites) and enriching job data with experience level and remote eligibility information.
* Leveraged Gemini's large language model capabilities to generate customized resumes and cover letters for each job application, tailoring applicant materials and highlighting relevant skills, improving applicant success rates.  
* Built a scalable, reliable data collection pipeline, mitigating API request failures (timeouts, rate limits) through exponential backoff strategies.
* Stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jinja, Google Gemini API, Third-party job board APIs

**Software Engineering Intern @ Oshkosh Corporation**
*Oshkosh, WI | January 2023 - May 2024*

* Developed a ROS 2-based LiDAR data fusion pipeline in Python and C++, increasing obstacle detection by 40% and adding rear-view obstacle classification to an autonomous vehicle prototype.
* Improved vehicle safety and mapping capabilities through enhanced obstacle detection and classification, directly supporting the development of fully autonomous refuse and mail truck pull-up functionality.
* Successfully deployed a proof-of-concept iteration of the autonomous driving stack, presented findings to company leadership (including the CTO), and secured approval for further research.
* Implemented strict coding standards and utilized GitHub's branching strategy, ensuring seamless integration into a complex, multi-engineer autonomous driving stack, using an Agile framework with daily scrums and monthly user story assignments.
* Stack: Proprietary ROS 2 Autoware Universe, Python, C++, Docker, NVIDIA Drive ORIN

**Lead Developer @ University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh**
